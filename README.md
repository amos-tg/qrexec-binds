This is a basic interface for using qubes qrexec-client-vm with rust. 
I know that the fastest way to do this would be to use the actual C 
functions from the qubes code, that is not the way things are currently
being accomplished. If in the future things change, I will do my best 
to maintain backwards compatibility.
